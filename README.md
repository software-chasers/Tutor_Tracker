# Tutor-Tracker

Tutor-Tracker is an Android application that is used as a tutor management tool for University of the Witwatersrand. This application allows tutors to register their attendance in tutorial venues and lecturers to verify the tutors' presence. At the end of the month, tutors then use a form generated by the app to claim remuneration for hours worked. These functionalities help the University pay students the deserved remunerations - *nothing less, nothing more*.
